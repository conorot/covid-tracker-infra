# Monitoring & Logging

The application uses **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging. The current setup includes alarming to the slack channel **#covid-tracker-alarms** via SNS+Lambda.

## Monitoring

The following alarms are in place right now:

- 5xx errors > 25 for 1 datapoint within 1 minute
- 4XX errors > 25 for 1 datapoint within 1 minute
- p95 api latency > 500ms for 1 datapoint within 1 minute

Alarms are enabled just for `production`.

## Logs

Multiple log groups can be queried via `Logs Insights` slecting the proper log groups.

* *Find all responses with specific status code*
